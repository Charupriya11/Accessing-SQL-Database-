Specifically For Mulesoft training 

I created a table called movie_details containing movie_name, actor, actress, release_year and director and inserted a records of 10. 
Then, implemented some queries to retrieve and access the data from the database using SQL.

# Queries:
1. Display all the records from the table 
2. Display the details whose actor name starts with 'S'
3. Display the count of movies where director made more than one movie
4. Display the details when the actor is Surya or Surya Sivakumar
5. Display the details with the director after the release of 2017
